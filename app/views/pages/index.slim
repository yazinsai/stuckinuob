h1 Welcome to Stuck in UoB

p The schedule smasher below will help you make the perfect schedule.
p Start by picking the courses you'd like to take:

select.chosen-select name="course"
  - @courses.each do |course|
    option = course.title

p We update the schedule with the UoB site directly every 6 hours, so you're always looking at the latest section information. No one likes a schedule checker that's stale! ðŸ‘ƒ
